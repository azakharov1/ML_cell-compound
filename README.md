# ML from image-based data (cells â€“ compound experiment)
Predict drug dosage learning on cell morphological data extracted by image segmentation from microscopy images (tumor MCF7 cells under podophyllotoxin treatment).

Data contains measuremnts for two independent channels: **n** channel for DAPI (shows DNA staining in cell nucleus) and **a** channel for actin (cell border)
